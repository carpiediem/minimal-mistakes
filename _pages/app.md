## The Goal

Although I'm usually turned off by politics, I've been impressed by tools that others have built to make government more transparent to its people. The Sunlight Foundation has a great (but retired) mobile app named, simply, "[Congress](https://web.archive.org/web/20160414012503/http://congress.sunlightfoundation.com/)." [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes) and the [Washington Post](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/) provide a similar service on the web.

I found that the Hong Kong government provides lots of data through its Open LegCo program, but there doesn't seem to be tools available to easily parse voting records and floor speeches to make them actionable. MyLegCo is an attempt to change that.

## Features

In its initial release, MyLegCo will list upcoming and recent meetings of committees, subcommittees, and the full council, plus constituencies, members, and parties. It will summarize bills under consideration and show the results of votes in the full council and major committees, down to individual member votes.

In future releases, bills, motions, and speeches will be searchable by topic and filterable by date or member. Users will be able to save motions, bills, or committees for later reference. Notifications would be configured to alert users when topics they care about are being discussed.

## Development Status

MyLegCo is currently being developed as a hybrid mobile app using the Cordova framework.  I'd like to make it available on both iOS and Android, but no release date has been set.
